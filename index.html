			My Dearest Ria,<br />
			I am incredibly grateful to have met you in my life, even with the distance that separates us. Do you remember the day we first met? It was such a funny yet adorable moment. Although we started off a little rough—with you calling me goofy and me being a bit tipsy—we quickly found a wonderful connection and enjoyed talking to each other.<br />
			I feel so fortunate to have shot my shot and asked for your socials, allowing us to prolong our conversations and deepen our connection. I am truly thankful that you chose to let me add you, out of all the people you could have selected.<br />
			Over the time we’ve spent together, I have realized just how beautiful you are, not only in appearance but in heart. You consistently look out for your loved ones, and you possess a remarkable determination. These little qualities have made me fall in love with you, and I hope to continue falling deeper as the days turn into months and then years.<br />
			Your care, love, and affection mean the world to me, and I wouldn't trade this for anything on Earth. I genuinely wish for nothing but your love and to nurture this beautiful relationship we share until the end of our days.<br />
			I want you to be a part of my life, and I hope you feel the same. Thank you for understanding my flaws and for always trying your best to fit in with me. Thank you for allowing me to love you, imperfections and all.<br />
			I’ve said it many times, and I’ll say it again: I love you so much. I would cross any obstacles that might come between us. Thank you, and I love you endlessly, baby.<br />
			<br>
			<br>
			All I want to say is:<br />
			Baby, I will love you forever;<br />
